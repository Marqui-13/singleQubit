# SingleQubit Quantum Operation

This repository demonstrates the `SingleQubit` operation, a fundamental concept in quantum computing showcasing superposition and measurement. The operation initializes a single qubit, applies a Hadamard gate to achieve a superposition of states, and then measures the qubit, resulting in a deterministic state of 0 or 1.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following prerequisites installed to work with the `SingleQubit` operation:

- Quantum Development Kit
- Compatible quantum simulator

Refer to the [Quantum Development Kit documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/quantum/) for detailed installation instructions.

## Installation

Clone the repository to begin exploring the `SingleQubit` operation:


git clone https://github.com/Marqui-13/singleQubitgit


## Usage

After cloning the repository, navigate to its directory and run the operation using the .NET Core CLI:


dotnet run --project yourProjectName


## Code Overview

The `SingleQubit` operation is succinctly defined as follows:


operation SingleQubit () : Unit {
    using (qubit = Qubit()) {
        H(qubit);
        Measure(qubit);
    }
}


This code snippet demonstrates creating a qubit, applying a Hadamard (H) gate to put the qubit into a superposition state, and measuring the outcome, which collapses the qubit into a classical state of either 0 or 1.
